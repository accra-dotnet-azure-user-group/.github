# Accra .NET & Azure User Group  
We are a developer-centric group focused on the Microsoft .NET, Azure, and other developer-related aspects of the Microsoft ecosystem. Our goal is to create a vibrant community of developers at all skill levels by equipping, supporting, and providing them with the resources they need to be successful, productive, and innovative.

We collaborate with various stakeholders and other communities to organize bootcamps, hackathons, workshops, hands-on labs, master classes for new developers, and informative sessions aimed at assisting startups and businesses of all sizes that have invested in or are planning to invest in the Microsoft ecosystem.

We offer opportunities for networking, knowledge sharing, business connections, job creation, and career growth. Join us and let's create the change we want to see.
